# Terrain_Tools (Work-in-progress)
Tools for procedural terrain generation. Either fractal (recommended) or pink noise methods are available, producing geometry data resembling terrain. Example uses are provided.

NOTE: the example files use WizardQuest for rendering the result, and will only work if that repository is added as a submodule. Everything else will still produce geometry data that can be used elsewhere. See utils/render.py for alternate rendering methods.
